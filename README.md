# redacted-scraper

Scrapes download links from  **[REDACTED]** and similarly styled websites (both specific searches and the home)

Unfortunately, **[REDACTED]** has a download quota. Because of this, I will not be releasing the name of this website publicly on this repo until it is down in hopes to not bombard them with tons of requests from people who can't handle themselves. If you ask I might tell though.


# Usage

```
Usage:
- Search (Example: "python redactedscraper.py search Infinity War")
- Home (Example: "python redactedscraper.py home")
```
